### General steps ###

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Workflow

Create new branch for your work (if it is a large change)
  
  All other development can happen in devl branch
  
Merge branch into devl (only if you used a new branch)

Merge devl into master
