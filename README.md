**** TODO ****
1) Create chart detailing basic components of the app and how they will/should interact
2) Create homepage of app
3) Look into incorporating unit tests for the project (karma most likely what we'd use)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
