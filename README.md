** Please use devl branch for dev work, and make side branches for smaller card work. **
** Workflow: Merge changes from side branches to devl, then merge devl into master. **

### General steps ###

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
