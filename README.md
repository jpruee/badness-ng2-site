## General steps

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Workflow

** dev branch is currently the default. let me know what you think of this. **

1) Create new branch for your work (if it is a large change)  
2) All other development should happen in dev branch  
3) Merge branch into dev (only if you used a new branch)  
4) Merge devl into master
